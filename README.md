ParPar
======

ParPar is a high performance, multi-threaded [PAR2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchive) creation tool and library for node.js. ParPar does not verify or repair files, only creates redundancy. ParPar is a completely new, from ground-up, implementation, which does not use components from existing PAR2 implementations.

ParPar provides three main things:

-   Command line tool for creating PAR2 files, like what par2cmdline does
-   High level JS API, with a similar interface to the command line tool
-   Low level JS API, providing a high degree of control over the creation process

**ParPar is currently still very much a work in progress, is not fully implemented and various issues still need to be solved. Please take this into consideration before using this tool for any non-experimental purposes.**

Features
--------

-   all main packets from the [PAR2 specification](http://parchive.sourceforge.net/docs/specifications/parity-volume-spec/article-spec.html)
-   unicode filename/comment support
-   asychronous calculations and I/O
-   multi-threading via OpenMP
-   multiple fast calculation implementations leveraging x86 (SSE2, SSSE3, AVX2, AVX512BW, GFNI) and ARM (NEON, SVE, SVE2) SIMD capabilities, automatically selecting the best routine for the CPU (see [benchmark comparisons](benchmarks/info.md))
-   multi-buffer (SIMD) MD5 implementation and accelerated CRC32 computation
-   single read pass on source files if memory constraints allow (no separate hashing pass required)
-   chunking support for memory constrained situations or for generating large amounts of recovery data
-   minimum chunk size restrictions to avoid heavy I/O seeking when memory is limited
-   cross-platform support
-   completely different implementation to all the par2cmdline forks, using fresh new ideas and approaches :)

Possible Future Features
------------------------

As mentioned above, ParPar is still under development. Some features currently not implemented include:

-   improve CLI handling, i.e. better interface
-   improve library interface, plus documentation
-   better handling of input buffering and processing chunks based on CPU cache size
-   improve handling of extremely large (e.g. gigabyte sized) slice sizes
-   various other tweaks

Unsupported Features
--------------------

Here’s a list of features currently *not* in ParPar, and may never be supported:

-   Support for external recovery data or packed slices (I don’t think any PAR2 client supports this)
-   Verify/repair PAR2
-   Some optimisations in weird edge cases, such as using slice sizes significantly larger than all input data

Motivation
----------

I needed a flexible library for creating PAR2 files, in particular, one which isn’t tied to the notion of on-disk files. ParPar *library* allows generating PAR2 from “immaterial files”, and the output doesn’t have to be written to disk.

Also, all the fast PAR2 implementations seem to be Windows only; ParPar provides a solution for high performance PAR2 creation on Linux (and probably other) systems (without Wine) and it also works on Windows, as well as non-x86 platforms (i.e. ARM).

Installation / Building
=======================

Pre-Built Binaries
------------------

Pre-packaged Windows builds with Node 8.x may be found on [the releases page](https://github.com/animetosho/ParPar/releases) if I can be bothered to provide them.

Install Via NPM
---------------

If NPM is installed (usually comes bundled with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)), the following command can be used to install ParPar:

```bash
npm install -g @animetosho/parpar
```

You’ll then be able to run ParPar via the **parpar** command.

If the **npm** command isn’t available, it can probably be installed via your package manager (`apt-get install npm` for Debian), or see the [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

If you get a `gyp ERR! stack Error: EACCES: permission denied` error when installing, try the following command instead:

```bash
npm install -g @animetosho/parpar --unsafe-perm
```

You can then later uninstall ParPar via:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @animetosho/parpar
```

Note that installing from NPM essentially compiles from source, so see issues listed in the following section if the install is failing on the build step.

Install From Source
-------------------

For building you’ll need node.js (0.10.x or later), node-gyp (can be obtained via `npm install -g node-gyp` command if NPM is available; may be in package managers otherwise) and relevant build tools (i.e. MS Visual C++ for Windows, GCC/Clang family otherwise). After you have the dependencies, the following commands can be used to build:

```bash
node-gyp rebuild
npm install
```

This sets up ParPar to be run from the *bin/parpar.js* file (i.e. via `node bin/parpar.js` command). If you want it to be globally accessible via the `parpar` command, the process is OS dependent. On Linux, you can usually create a symlink named *parpar* in a location specified in the `PATH` environment variable, to *bin/parpar.js* (e.g. `ln -s bin/parpar.js /usr/bin/parpar`). On Windows, either add the *bin* folder to your `PATH` environment, or copy *bin/parpar.cmd* to a `PATH` specified directory and edit the paths appropriately in this copy of *parpar.cmd*.

Note, Windows builds are always compiled with SSE2 support. If you can’t have this, delete all instances of `"msvs_settings": {"VCCLCompilerTool": {"EnableEnhancedInstructionSet": "2"}},` in *binding.gyp* before compiling.

Relatively recent compilers (any supported compiler released in the last \~4 years should work) are needed if AVX support is desired. AVX512 support requires even newer compilers (GCC 5+, MSVC 2017 or later etc).

### Building without NPM

If you do not have NPM installed, ParPar can be built easily if your system's package manager has the necessary packages.

Debian 8 is such a system (should also be fine on Ubuntu 14.04), and here's how APT can be used:

```bash
apt-get install nodejs node-gyp node-async
node-gyp rebuild
```

Note that you'll also need node-yencode; [follow the instructions here](https://animetosho.org/app/node-yencode) on how to build it. After building it, create a folder named *node_modules* and place the folder *yencode* in there.

### Native binary targeting

By default, the `-march=native` flag is used during builds, which optimises the build for the CPU it’s being built on, at the expense of not being portable. If you want the build to be portable, change the value of the `enable_native_tuning%` variable in *binding.gyp* to `0`. Also check that you disable the same thing with the *yencode* module.

### Multi-Threading Support

ParPar’s multi-threading support requires OpenMP. If ParPar is compiled without OpenMP, it will only ever run on 1 thread. OpenMP is usually available in most compilers that you’d likely use. On some systems, you may need to ensure that the `libomp-dev` package is installed.

It appears that the default compiler in MacOSX does not include OpenMP support (at time of writing). If this is the case, you may need to fetch another build of the C++ compiler which has OpenMP support (e.g. clang/gcc from places like homebrew/macports) and override the `CXX` environment variable when installing.

### “no suitable image found” error on MacOS 10.15

Due to security changes in OSX 10.15, libraries may require code signing to work. To deal with this, you’ll either need to [disable this security option](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_disable-library-validation?language=objc) or [codesign the built .node module](https://successfulsoftware.net/2018/11/16/how-to-notarize-your-software-on-macos/). Note that I do not have OSX and can’t provide much support for the platform.

API
===

*Note: the terms* slices *and* blocks *are used interchangeably here*

Simple Example
--------------

This is a basic example of the high level JS API (note, API not yet finalised so names etc. may change in future):

```javascript
var par2creator = require('@animetosho/parpar').run(
    ['file1', 'file2'],   // array of input files
    1024*1024,   // 1MB slice size; if you want a slice count instead, give it as a negative number, e.g. -10 means select a slice size which results in 10 input slices
    {   // options; all these are optional
        outputBase: 'my_recovery_set',
        recoverySlices: { // can also be an array of such objects, of which the sum all these are used
            unit: 'slices', // slices/count, ratio, bytes, largest_files, smallest_files, power, log or ilog
            value: ,
            scale: 1 // multiply the number of blocks by this amount
        },
        
        // the following are the default values for other options
        //outputBase: '', // output filename without extension
        minSliceSize: null, // null => use sliceSize; give negative number to indicate slice count
        maxSliceSize: null,
        sliceSizeMultiple: 4,
        //recoverySlices: 0,
        minRecoverySlices: null, // null => recoverySlices
        maxRecoverySlices: {
            unit: 'slices',
            value: 65537
        },
        recoveryOffset: 0,
        memoryLimit: null, // 0 to specify no limit
        minChunkSize: 128*1024, // 0 to disable chunking
        processBatchSize: 12,
        hashBatchSize: 8,
        recDataSize: null, // null => ceil(hashBatchSize*1.5)
        comments: [], // array of strings
        unicode: null, // null => auto, false => never, true => always generate unicode packets
        outputOverwrite: false,
        outputIndex: true,
        outputSizeScheme: 'pow2', // equal, uniform or pow2
        outputFirstFileSlices: null, // null => default, otherwise pass in same format as outputFileMaxSlices
        outputFirstFileSlicesRounding: 'round', // round, floor or ceil
        outputFileMaxSlices: {
            unit: 'slices',
            value: 65536
        },
        outputFileMaxSlicesRounding: 'round', // round, floor or ceil
        criticalRedundancyScheme: 'pow2', // none or pow2
        outputAltNamingScheme: true,
        displayNameFormat: 'common', // basename, keep, common, outrel or path
        displayNameBase: '.', // base path, only used if displayNameFormat is 'path'
        seqReadSize: 4*1048576,
        readBuffers: 8,
        readHashQueue: 5,
        numThreads: null, // null => number of processors
        gfMethod: null, // null => '' (auto)
		loopTileSize: 0, // 0 = auto
    },
    function(err) {
        console.log(err || 'Process finished');
    }
);
par2creator.on('info', function(par) {
    console.log('Creating PAR2 archive with ' + par.opts.recoverySlices*par.opts.sliceSize + ' byte(s) of recovery data from ' + par.totalSize + ' input bytes');
});
par2creator.on('begin_pass', function(par, passNum, passChunkNum) {
    console.log('Begin read pass ' + passNum + ' of ' + par.passes + ' pass(es)');
});
par2creator.on('processing_slice', function(par, file, sliceNum) {
    console.log('Processing slice #' + sliceNum + ' of ' + par.inputSlices + ' from ' + file.name);
});
par2creator.on('pass_complete', function(par, passNum, passChunkNum) {
    console.log('Completed read pass ' + passNum + ' of ' + par.passes + ' pass(es)');
});
par2creator.on('files_written', function(par, passNum, passChunkNum) {
    console.log('Written data for read pass ' + passNum);
});
```

## Low Level API

ParPar can be operated at a lower level API, which gives more control over the creation process, but requires a deeper understanding of how the application operates and has a number of constraints. This API is undocumented, but examples can be found in [the examples folder](examples/).

Development
===========

Running Tests
-------------

Currently only some very basic test scripts are included, which can be found in the aptly named *test* folder.

*md5.js* tests the internal MD5 implementation against the reference OpenSSL implementation in Node.

*par-compare.js* tests PAR2 generation by comparing output from ParPar against that of par2cmdline. As such, par2cmdline needs to be installed for tests to be run. Note that tests will cover extreme cases, including those using large amounts of memory, generating large amounts of recovery data and so on. As such, you will likely need a machine with large amounts of RAM available (preferrably at least 8GB) and reasonable amount of free disk space available (20GB or more recommended) to successfully run all tests.  
The test will write several files to a temporary location (sourced from `TEMP` or `TMP` environment variables, or the current working directory if none set) and will likely take a while to complete.

Building Binary
---------------

Compiling ParPar into a single binary can be done via [nexe](https://github.com/nexe/nexe) 1.x. There is a little complication with bundling the *yencode* 1.0.x module, but a rather fragile script has been supplied in *nexe/build.js* to help with the process. The following general steps need to be taken:

1.  Ensure that *nexe* is installed (doesn’t need to be globally installed) and [its requirements](https://github.com/nexe/nexe#building-requirements) met
    
2.  Download a Node.js source package. The script has mostly been tested with Node 4.x.x and 8.x.x, it may work with other versions
    
3.  The required ParPar libraries need to be installed into the *node_modules* folder
    
4.  Inside the *nexe* folder (the one containing *build.js*), create the following two folders: *node* and *yencode-src*
    
5.  Inside the *node* folder, create a folder with the version number of the package you downloaded in step 2, for example “4.9.1”. Inside *this* folder, create one named “\_” and place the downloaded sources in this folder. After doing this, the file *nexe/node/x.x.x/\_/node.gyp* should exist, where *x.x.x* is the node version number
    
6.  Inside the *yencode-src* folder, copy the source code for the *yencode* module
    
7.  Edit *nexe/build.js*; options that are likely to be edited are at the top of the file. You’ll likely need to change *nodeVer* to be the version of node you’re using
    
8.  In the *nexe* folder, run *build.js*. This script patches node to embed the yencode module, and customises a few compiler options, then calls nexe to build the final executable. If it worked, you should get a binary named *parpar* or *parpar.exe* in the nexe folder

Note that this will be built with the `-flto` option on non-Windows platforms. If this causes build failures, your system’s `ar` utility may not support LTO objects, which can be worked around if you have `gcc-ar` installed by issuing a command like `export AR=gcc-ar`

Alternatives
============

For a list of command-line PAR2 tools, [see here](benchmarks/info.md#applications-tested-and-commands-given).

For a nodejs module, there’s [node-par2](https://github.com/andykant/par2) which is not an implementation of PAR2, rather a wrapper around par2cmdline.

For a C++ library implementation, there’s [libpar2](https://launchpad.net/libpar2), which I believe is based off par2cmdline.
